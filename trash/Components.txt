- A JSON based language for mapping relative paths to a JSON document

- The core template only makes use of variables




The most complex part is to allow sparql variables as keys.

{
   id: '?s',
   properties: [{key: '?p', value: '?o}]
}


Jamsa.createDoc(
    {
        id: '?s',
        '?p': '?o'     // Possibly '?p': ['?o'] 
    },
    '?s ?p ?o'
);
