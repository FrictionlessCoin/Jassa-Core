This project uses this great plugin to minimize the JavaScript https://github.com/samaxes/minify-maven-plugin

To minify, run:
mvn package

The resulting files will be created under

target/jassa/webapp/resources/js/jassa.js
target/jassa/webapp/resources/js/jassa.min.js

and are ready for inclusion in other js projects or for deployment into another Java web app. Yay.
