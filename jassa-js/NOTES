This project uses this great plugin to minimize the JavaScript https://github.com/samaxes/minify-maven-plugin

To minify, run:
mvn package

The resulting files will be created under

target/jassa/webapp/resources/js/jassa.js
target/jassa/webapp/resources/js/jassa.min.js

and are ready for inclusion in other js projects or for deployment into another Java web app. Yay.




The rdf and vocab namespace are a bit interleaved, as the literal part of rdf makes use of the xsd vocab.

<param>rdf/rdf-core.js</param>
<param>vocab/util.js</param>
<param>vocab/xsd.js</param>
<param>rdf/rdf-literals.js</param>

copy to release repo
cp target/jassa/webapp/resources/js/jassa.js ~/Projects/Eclipse/jassa-bower/
